          What is GST Notice?
        </h2>
        <p className="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed">
          Notices under GST serve as official communications from GST
          Authorities to taxpayers. These notices serve various purposes,
          including reminders of detected defaults in compliance with GST laws
          or requests for additional taxpayer information. They are crucial in
          maintaining tax compliance and ensuring the proper functioning of the
          GST system.
        </p>
        <p className="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mt-4">
          These notices may go by different names, the specific type of notice
          depends on factors such as the nature of the default detected or the
          actions required from the taxpayer. Common grounds for receiving
          notices include failure to register under GST when required by law,
          late or non-filing of GST returns, underpayment or non-payment of GST,
          and incorrect claims of Input Tax Credit. Upon receiving a notice,
          taxpayers must respond promptly within the specified timeframe.

          Common Reasons for Receiving GST Notices
        </h2>
        <p className="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-4">
          Below are the primary reasons why GST authorities might issue notices:
        </p>
        <ul className="list-disc list-inside text-gray-600 space-y-2">
          <li>
            Discrepancies between details reported in GSTR-1 and GSTR-3B lead to
            a scrutiny notice.
          </li>
          <li>
            Variances in Input Tax Credit (ITC) claims in GSTR-3B compared to
            GSTR-2B/2A.
          </li>
          <li>
            Failing to file GSTR-1 and GSTR-3B for over six months
            consecutively.
          </li>
          <li>
            Mismatches in information declared on GSTR-1 and the e-way bill
            portal.
          </li>
          <li>
            Prices are not lowering following a GST rate cut as mandated by the
            Central Board of Indirect Taxes and Customs (CBIC), constituting
            profiteering and violating consumer rights to benefit from reduced
            rates.
          </li>
          <li>
            Non-payment or underpayment of GST, potentially leading to a show
            cause notice (SCN), regardless of fraudulent intent.
          </li>
          <li>
            Inappropriate claims for GST refunds, with or without fraudulent
            intent, attracting a show cause notice (SCN).
          </li>
          <li>Incorrect availing or use of Input Tax Credit.</li>
          <li>
            Operating without GST registration when required and not fulfilling
            tax and other obligations under the GST Act.
          </li>
          <li>
            Reporting inconsistencies for exports in GSTR-1, especially when
            shipping or export bills are lodged in ICEGATE but not reflected in
            GSTR-1.
          </li>
          <li>
            Failure to provide required record-keeping information to tax
            authorities.
          </li>
          <li>Undergoing audits conducted by tax authorities.</li>
          <li>
            Not submitting information returns to tax authorities within the
