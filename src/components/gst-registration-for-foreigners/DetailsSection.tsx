          GST Registration for Foreigners
        </h2>
        <p className="mt-4">
          Following the implementation of the GST framework, the Government of

          country. If you're planning to supply goods or services to India,
          securing a GST registration is not just a compliance measure but a key

        <p className="mt-4">
          A "Non Resident Taxable Person" under the Goods and Services Tax (GST)
          framework in India refers to any individual or business entity that
          conducts transactions involving the supply of goods or services, or
          both, within India but does not have a fixed place of business or
          residence in the country. This includes entities operating in India
          occasionally, in any capacity such as principal, agent, or any other
          manner, but with their base of operations or residence outside of
          India. The GST law mandates that these non-resident entities register
          under GST and comply with its provisions, regardless of the volume or
          frequency of their transactions in India.

          GST Registration in India is a compulsory process for foreign
          individuals or entities that supply goods or services in India without
          a permanent establishment or residence in the country. This
          registration category is specifically designed for those who may not

          transactions under the GST regime.

          The process involves obtaining a unique GSTIN (Goods and Services Tax

          applicable taxes on their transactions within India.

          Extension of GST Registration Validity
        </h3>
        <p className="mt-4">
          Suppose the NRI wishes to extend the registration beyond the initially
          approved period (up to ninety days or the period specified in the
          application). In that case, they must file an extension application
          using Form GST REG-11 before the current registration expires.
        </p>
        <p className="mt-4">
          This extension also requires an additional advance tax deposit for the
          extended period. This detailed procedure ensures that NRIs are
          well-informed and prepared to meet all regulatory requirements for
          conducting taxable transactions in India under the GST regime.
