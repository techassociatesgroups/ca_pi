          <p>
            ISO registration refers to registering an organization with an
            external certification body to obtain certification for compliance
            with one or more standards established and published by the
            International Organization for Standardization (ISO). ISO is a
            non-governmental, independent international organization that brings
            together experts worldwide to develop global standards that address
            various issues and promote technological advancement. Applying for
            an ISO certificate online is a simple process where you submit your
            business details and required documents to a certification body.
            Once verified, you receive your ISO certification digitally.
          </p>
          <p className="mt-4">
            ISO certificate registration involves an extensive audit and
            assessment process by an external certification body to determine
            whether the organization meets the applicable ISO standard
            requirements. The certification body will review the organization's
            operations, procedures, and systems to ensure they comply with the
            relevant ISO standard.
