          If your business sells food or edible items, adhering to the FSSAI
          (Food Safety and Standards Authority of India) Act regulations is
          crucial. This legal framework requires your business to be officially
          registered with the government and obtain a license from the Food
          Safety Department. Whether you are a small-scale or large-scale food
          business engaged in manufacturing, storing, transporting, or
          distributing food, obtaining FSSAI registration or a license,

          The FSSAI registration number, consisting of 14 digits, is issued by
          the State Licensing Authority. Notably, the first digit of the
          registration number begins with the digit 2.
        </p>

        <h3>FSSAI License for Food Businesses</h3>
        <p>
          An FSSAI License is a crucial requirement for enterprises with a
          turnover exceeding Rs. 12 lakhs and for Food Business Operators (FBOs)
          engaged in food processing and manufacturing. This license is divided
          into two primary types: Central FSSAI License and State FSSAI License.
          The FSSAI license is identified by a 14-digit code with the initial
          digit 1. The choice between a State or central license depends on the
          scale of the business. The validity of the license must be maintained
          through FSSAI License Renewal. With the FSSAI license online check,
          you can check the authenticity and validity of your license.
        </p>

        <h4>State License</h4>
        <p>
          FBOs such as medium-scale processors, manufacturers, traders,
          marketers, or transporters fall within the jurisdiction of the FSSAI
          state license, which the respective state government grants.
          Medium-sized FBOs with an annual turnover surpassing Rs. 12 lakhs but
          not exceeding Rs. 20 Crores are required to obtain a state license. A
          central license becomes mandatory if an FBO's annual turnover exceeds
          Rs. 20 Crores.
        </p>

        <h4>Central License</h4>
        <p>
          Large-scale enterprises involved in food processing, transportation,
          manufacturing, and international trade of food products are obligated
          to obtain the FSSAI central license. An FBO is classified as a large
          business if its annual turnover exceeds Rs. 20 Crores, necessitating
          acquiring the FSSAI central license from the Central Government.
