          GSTR-10 Return Filing
        </h2>
        <p className="text-gray-600">
          Every registered taxpayer is required to file GST returns depending
          upon their type of registration, turnover, and other criteria. GSTR-10
          is one such document used by businesses to file their final GST
          return. It is used to declare the closure or cancellation of
          registration of a GSTIN. This document helps inform the tax
          authorities about the cancellation of registration of the GSTIN and
          the deregistration of the taxpayer.
        </p>
        <p className="text-gray-600 mt-4">
          GSTR-10 must be filed by all taxpayers who have applied for GST
          registration but have not been granted the same. All registered
          taxpayers must also file GSTR-10 if they have cancelled their
          registration or have been cancelled by the tax authorities.
        </p>
        <p className="text-gray-600 mt-4">
          GSTR-10 is an essential document for businesses as it helps them to
          declare the closure or cancellation of registration of GSTIN. It is
          also important for the tax authorities to keep track of the taxpayers
          who have cancelled or deregistered their GSTIN.

          What advantages come with filing GSTR-10?
        </h3>
        <p className="text-gray-600">
          GSTR-10 is a return that needs to be filed by a taxpayer whose GST
          registration has been cancelled or surrendered. Filing GSTR-10 gives
          taxpayers access to several advantages.
        </p>
        <ul className="list-disc list-inside text-gray-600 mt-2 space-y-1">
          <li>
            Compliance: Filing GSTR-10 is a compliance requirement under GST
            law. Failing to file the return on time can result in paying a GSTR
            10 late fees and facing legal consequences.
          </li>
          <li>
            Avoid interest and penalties: Filing GSTR-10 within the due date
            helps avoid interest and penalties. If the return is not filed
            within the due date, a penalty of Rs.100 per day or maximum up to
            0.25% of the turnover will be levied.
          </li>
          <li>
            Closure of registration: Filing GSTR-10 helps in the closure of the
            registration and avoids any future liabilities. It ensures that all
            the liabilities are settled before the cancellation or surrender of
            GST registration.
          </li>
          <li>
            Input Tax Credit: Filing GSTR-10 helps the taxpayer to claim any
            input tax credit that has not been claimed or reversed earlier. It
            is mandatory to claim the credit before filing GSTR-10.
          </li>
          <li>
            Compliance rating: Filing GSTR-10 on time helps maintain a sound
            compliance rating, which is vital for businesses in the long run.
