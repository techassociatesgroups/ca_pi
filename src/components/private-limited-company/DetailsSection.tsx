          What is a private limited company?
        </h2>
        <p className="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed">
          In India, a private limited company is a privately held entity with
          limited liability, and it ranks among the nation's most favored
          business structures. This popularity is primarily attributed to its
          numerous advantages, including limited liability protection, ease of
          formation and maintenance, and its status as a distinct legal entity.
          This encourages a prospective businessman to engage in the
          incorporation of private limited company. A private limited company
          enjoys legal separation from its owners and necessitates a minimum of
          two members and two directors for its operation. Here are the key
          characteristics of a private limited company in India, which justify
          the PVT LTD company registration:

          With the introduction of the SPICe+ (INC-32) form, the process has
          been streamlined into a single online application with the Ministry of

          reduced registration time and improved efficiency—making it easier for
          startups and businesses to launch and expand operations in India.
