          International trade is a gateway to a world of opportunities for
          businesses in India. Whether you're looking to import goods, export
          products, or expand your business globally, having an Importer
          Exporter Code (IEC) is your key to entering the international market.
          This import and export code is issued by the Directorate General of
          Foreign Trade (DGFT), under the Ministry of Commerce. All the
          importers and exporters in India must know what is IEC Code. For
          importers, the DGFT IEC and import and export license are
          indispensable for the clearance of customs and facilitating payments
          to foreign banks, ensuring smooth international trade transactions.
          Similarly, exporters rely on the IEC to streamline the process of
          sending shipments and receiving payments from overseas clients.

          <p>
            IEC Code Full Form is "Importer Exporter Code". Import and Export
            Code is to be obtained by the business entity for import into or
            export from India. Import & Export Code is popularly known as the
            IEC number. Import & Export Code is a ten-digit unique number issued
            by the Directorate General of Foreign Trade (DGFT).
          </p>
          <p>
            DGFT IEC registration certificate is mandatory for a business
            involved in import and export. Hence, before initiating an import of
            goods into India, an importer must ensure that the importing entity
            has GST registration and IE code, both of which are required to
            clear customs.
          </p>
          <p>
            If an importer does not have both GST and import and export license,
            the goods will be stuck at the port and start incurring demurrage
            charges or could be destroyed. Ensure to follow the key rules and
            regulations while engaging in the process of IEC Code Apply through
