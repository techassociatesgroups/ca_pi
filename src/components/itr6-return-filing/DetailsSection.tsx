          used for charitable or religious purposes are not eligible to file ITR
          6.

          The Importance of Timely ITR Filing for Companies
        </h2>
        <p className="text-gray-600 mb-4">
          Filing ITR 6 on or before the due date not only ensures compliance
          with tax laws but also offers several financial and operational
          advantages for your business.
        </p>

        <ul className="list-disc pl-6 text-gray-600 space-y-3">
          <li>
            <strong>Carry Forward of Losses:</strong> Filing on time allows a
            company to carry forward its losses for adjustment against future
            profits. According to Section 72 of the Income Tax Act, companies
            can carry forward business losses up to 8 subsequent assessment
            years.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Avoiding Penalties and Interest:</strong> Late filing incurs
            a fee under Section 234F of the Income Tax Act. Additionally, timely
            filing helps avoid interest charges on any outstanding tax
            liabilities.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Reduced Risk of Scrutiny:</strong> Timely filing minimizes
            the risk of scrutiny by tax authorities. Late submissions can raise
            red flags, potentially leading to notices and further examinations.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Quicker Refund Processing:</strong> Filing your income tax
            return on time facilitates faster processing of tax refunds from the
            income tax department.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Enhanced Credit Opportunities:</strong> Timely filed tax
            returns are often required by banks and financial institutions as
            part of loan and credit facility applications.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Smoother Winding-Up Process:</strong> If a company decides
            to cease operations, having all Income Tax returns filed on time is
            essential for a smoother and quicker winding-up process.
