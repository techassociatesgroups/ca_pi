          What is a business tax return?
        </h2>
        <p className="text-gray-600 mb-4">
          A business tax return refers to an income tax return for businesses. A
          business income tax return is a comprehensive report that outlines a
          business's income, expenses, and pertinent tax details, all presented
          in a designated form. It entails the submission of income tax returns
          for businesses, with the added requirement of reporting Tax Deducted
          at Source (TDS). This process must be carried out annually.
        </p>
        <p className="text-gray-600">
          This return serves as a financial statement detailing earnings. It
          outlays and is a documentation of additional financial components like
          fixed assets, loans obtained, loans extended, debtors, and creditors
          within the business.
