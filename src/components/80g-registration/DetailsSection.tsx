          What is Section 80G?
        </h3>
        <p>
          Section 80G of the Income Tax Act 1961 is a provision that allows
          individuals and organisations to claim tax deductions on donations
          made to eligible charitable organisations. When an organisation
          obtains an 80G certificate, it has been registered and recognised by
          the Income Tax Department as eligible to receive donations that
          qualify for tax exemption. Donors who contribute to such organisations
          can claim deductions on their taxable income for the amount donated up
          to a specified limit, thereby reducing their tax liability and
          encouraging charitable giving.

          What is 80G registration?
        </h3>
        <p>
          80G registration enables donors to claim tax deductions on donations
          made to eligible charitable organisations.
        </p>
        <p>
          The registration grants tax benefits to both the donor and the
          recipient. Charitable organisations registered under Section 80G are
          entitled to receive tax-deductible donations, and donors can claim
          deductions on the amount donated while filing their income tax
          returns.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Finance Act 2020 introduced amendments to India's 80G registration
          provisions. These amendments include the requirement for organizations
          with 80G registration to file annual returns, verification of donees
          by the Income Tax Department, and the possibility of reassessing and
          revoking registrations for non-compliance.
        </p>

          Importance of 80G Registration
        </h3>
        <p>
          80G Registration under the Income Tax Act allows donors, whether
          individuals, companies, associations, or organisations, to claim
          deductions on their total income for donations to an NGO. This
          exemption is provided under Section 80G of the Income Tax Act,
          stipulating that the donated amount must not exceed ten per cent of
          the donor's gross total income.
        </p>
        <p>
          Donations must be made in monetary form, and only financial
          transactions are considered valid under this section. When issuing
          receipts for donations, NGOs must include the number and date of the
          80G certificate, indicating the validity period of the certificate.
        </p>

        </h3>
        <p>
          Before proceeding to the process of how to apply 80G certificate, one
          must be qualified for 80G registration. The following criteria must
          met by the charitable organisations:
        </p>
        <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
          <li>
            <strong>Legal Structure:</strong> The organization must be
            registered under a recognized legal structure in India, such as a
            trust, society, or non-profit company.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Non-Profit Objective:</strong> The organisation's primary
            focus should be charitable activities, not profit generation.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Proper Documentation:</strong> The organization must
            maintain accurate accounting records and have its accounts audited
            annually to ensure compliance with income tax regulations.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Compliance with Statutory Requirements:</strong> To be
            eligible for 80 G registration, the organization must adhere to all
            requirements under Sections 11 and 12 of the Income Tax Act.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Non-Exempt Business Income:</strong> The organization should
            not have any non-exempt income from business activities. If there is
            business income, it must maintain separate accounting records, and
            donations should only be used for charitable purposes.
          </li>
          <li>

            focus exclusively on benefiting a specific religious community or
            caste.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Darpan Portal Registration:</strong> For registration or
            re-validation, obtaining a registration number from the Darpan
            portal of Niti Aayog is mandatory, especially if the organisation
            receives or plans to receive grants or assistance from the Central
            or State Government.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Audit Reports:</strong> If the NGO's total income exceeds
            the minimum threshold specified under the Income Tax Act, its
            accounts must be audited by a chartered accountant.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Utilization of Funds:</strong> At least 85% of the income
            should be spent on the organizationâ€™s objectives within India to
            ensure the funds are used effectively for charitable purposes.
          </li>
        </ul>

          80G Registration Validity and Renewal
        </h3>
        <p>
          The initial provisional registration under Section 80G is valid for
          three years. After this period, organizations must renew their
          registration. Following a successful renewal, the registration is
          valid for an additional five years. To continue enjoying the benefits
          of 80G registration, organisations must renew it every five years
          thereafter.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Important Note:</strong> For Section 8 companies, the validity
          of 80G registration is till March 2025. It must be renewed for

          80g registration Process
        </h3>
        <p>
          The process for obtaining 80G registration for NGOs can be approached
          in two ways, depending on whether the organisation is a new entrant or
          seeking renewal of an existing provisional registration.
        </p>
        <h4 className="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-800 pt-2">
          Process for Section 80g Provisional Registration
        </h4>
        <p>
          To receive an 80G Registration Certificate, follow these four basic
          steps:
        </p>
        <ol className="list-decimal pl-6 space-y-2">
          <li>
            <strong>Application Submission:</strong> Submit an application in
            Form No. 10A for 80G registration to the Commissioner of the Income
            Tax Department in the organisation's jurisdictional region.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Document Examination:</strong> Once the application and
            documents are submitted, the Income Tax Department will thoroughly
            examine the provided materials.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Additional Information (if required):</strong> If the
            officials require additional information, they will request further
            documents from you. You must submit the requested documents within
            the specified time frame.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Certification Issuance:</strong> If the department is
            satisfied with verifying the papers and information presented, the
            Commissioner will issue the 80G Certificate to the organisation.
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          <strong>Note:</strong> The validity of the 80g provisional
          registration starts from the Assessment Year for which the
          organisation sought the registration. The renewal application should
          be submitted:
        </p>
        <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
          <li>
            At least six months before the end of the current validity period,
            or
          </li>
          <li>
            Within six months from the commencement of their activities,
            whichever comes first.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          The Transition from 80g Provisional Registration to Regular 80G
          Registration: Before the provisional registration expires, NGOs must
          apply for regular registration, which is valid for five years. This
          stage involves a detailed review of the NGOâ€™s activities and financial
          records.

            conduct an on-site inspection to verify the NGOâ€™s information.
