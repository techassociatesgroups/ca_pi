          GST (CGST), State GST (SGST), and Integrated GST (IGST) regulations.
          The return is a consolidated record of all monthly or quarterly
          returns submitted within the corresponding year.

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-800">What is GSTR 9?</h2>
        <p className="mt-4 text-gray-600">
          GSTR-9 is a yearly report that registered taxpayers need to submit.
          This report contains everything they bought and sold throughout the
          year, including different taxes (like CGST, SGST, and IGST). It also
          covers their total sales and purchases and audit details for the year.
          In short, GSTR-9 summarizes a whole year's business transactions and
          tax details. The GST annual return limit for businesses is Rs. 2
          crore, but filing is optional for those with a turnover up to Rs. 2
          crore.
