      <Paragraph>
        Sole Proprietorship registration in India follows a unique approach, as

        online gains recognition through tax registrations mandated by relevant
        laws and regulations. One pivotal tax registration is the GST (Goods and
        Services Tax) Registration, which must be secured under the proprietor's
        name to formalize the business's proprietorship status. This sole
        proprietorship registration online signifies that the proprietor is
        conducting business within the framework of a proprietorship. CA PI
