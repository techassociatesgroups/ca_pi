          Overview GST Registration India Online
        </h2>
        <p className="mt-2 text-gray-600">
          Since its introduction on 1 July 2017, the Goods & Services Tax (GST)
          has been mandatory for all service providers, traders, manufacturers,
          and even freelancers in India. The GST system was implemented to
          replace Central and state-level taxes such as Service Tax, Excise
          Duty, CST, Entertainment Tax, Luxury Tax, and VAT, making the tax
          process more streamlined. The GST registration process charges vary
          depending on the type of business and turnover.
        </p>
        <p className="mt-2 text-gray-600">
          For those taxpayers whose annual turnover is less than 1.5 crore, the
          GST framework provides an option for a composition scheme. This scheme
          allows them to undergo simplified GST procedures and pay taxes at a
          predetermined rate according to their turnover.
        </p>
        <p className="mt-2 text-gray-600">
          The GST mechanism operates throughout various stages of the supply
          chain. This includes acquiring raw materials, production, wholesale,
          retail, and the eventual sale to the end consumer. Notably, GST is
          imposed at every one of these steps. For example, when a product is
          produced in West Bengal and then used in Uttar Pradesh, the GST
          revenue generated is allocated entirely to Uttar Pradesh, emphasizing
          the consumption-based nature of GST.

        <p className="mt-2 text-gray-600">
          GST return filing is a formal process in which a taxpayer provides the
          government with information regarding their sales, purchases, and
          taxes collected and disbursed. In India, every GST-registered taxpayer
          must submit these returns consistently, even if there were no sales or
          purchases during a particular period. CA PI helps you with GST
          registration and stay compliant with affordable GST registration
