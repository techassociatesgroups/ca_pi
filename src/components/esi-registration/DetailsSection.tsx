          Employee State Insurance (ESI) registration is a mandatory compliance
          requirement for businesses in India, governed by the Employee State
          Insurance Corporation (ESIC). This scheme provides social security and
          health insurance benefits to Indian workers earning a specified
          monthly wage, typically extending to their dependents. Depending on

            ESI (Employee State Insurance) operates following the ESI Act of
            1948. It is a government scheme designed to provide social security
            benefits to workers. The administration of this scheme falls under
            the purview of the Employee State Insurance Corporation (ESIC).
            Employers must formally register their establishments with ESIC and
            furnish worker details for inclusion in the program.
          </p>
          <p>
            Complying with the intricate regulations stipulated by the
            government can pose a significant challenge for employers. CA PI'
            ESI experts are available to assist you with these matters.

            Definition and Scope of Establishments Under the ESI Act

            shops, which are mandated to enroll in the ESI scheme if they employ
            10 workers or 20 in certain states, provided these employees earn up
            to Rs. 21,000 per month, or Rs. 25,000 for individuals with
            disabilities.

            Compliances After ESIC Registration
          </h3>
          <p>
            After ESI (Employee's State Insurance) registration, an
            establishment must adhere to specific compliances and file requisite
            ESI returns. These obligations are crucial for ensuring seamless
            operation and adherence to regulatory standards. The mandatory
            compliances include:
          </p>
          <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
            <li>
              <strong>Attendance Register Maintenance:</strong> The
              establishment must diligently maintain an attendance register to
              record the attendance of all employees. This serves as a
              fundamental document for compliance and internal record-keeping.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Register of Wages:</strong> A comprehensive register of
              wages for workers should be meticulously maintained. This register
              is vital for transparent documentation of salary details and
              ensures compliance with ESIC regulations.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Inspection Book:</strong> An inspection book must be kept
              to record any inspection on the premises. This facilitates
              transparency and regulatory compliance during official
              inspections.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Monthly Return and Challan Submission:</strong> The
              establishment must submit monthly returns and challans within the
              first 15 days of the succeeding month. This includes providing
              details of employees, their attendance, and the corresponding
              contributions to the ESIC.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Accident Register:</strong> A register documenting
              accidents on the premises is mandatory. Accurate recording of
              accidents is essential for compliance. It facilitates a proactive
              approach towards workplace safety.
            </li>

          <p>
            These are crucial obligations that must be met. Other compliance
            regulations for EPF and ESIC registration have to be followed which
