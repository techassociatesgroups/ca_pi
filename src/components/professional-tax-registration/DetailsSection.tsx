          Professional tax is a direct tax levied on persons earning an income
          by either practicing a profession, employment, calling, or trade.
          Unlike income tax imposed by the Central Government, professional tax
          payment is levied by the government of a state or union territory in
          India. In the case of salaried and wage earners, the professional tax
          is liable to be deducted by the Employer from the salary/wages, and
          the same is to be deposited to the state government. In the case of
          other classes of individuals, this tax is liable to be paid by the
          employee himself. The tax calculation and amount collected may vary
          from one State to another, but it has a maximum limit of Rs. 2500/-
          per year. To comply with these rules, the P tax registration must be
          completed by the respective entity without fail.

            gross income of the professional. It is deducted from his income
            every month.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Commercial Taxes Department of a state/union territory is the
            nodal agency that collects professional tax on the basis of
            predetermined tax slabs which vary for each state and union
            territory. The tax is calculated on the annual taxable income of the
            individual; however, it can be paid either annually or monthly.

            Penalties Related To Professional Tax Registration
          </h3>
          <p>
            When professional tax policy becomes applicable, all such
            jurisdictions may impose a penalty for failure to register
            Profession Tax. However, the precise amount of the Penalty will
            depend on state regulatory law.
          </p>
          <p>
            There are also penalties for failing to submit the PT return by the
            deadline and withholding payments after they are due. Each stateâ€™s
            professional tax regulations determine the actual fine. Businesses
            that fail to register professional tax, pay taxes late, or file
            returns on time may face fines, late fees, or imprisonment.
          </p>
          <p>
            Failure to make a payment by the due date and failure to file a
            return by the due date carries additional penalties. For example,
            the following information outlines the penalty amount imposed by the
