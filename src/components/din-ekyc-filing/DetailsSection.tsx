      <h2>DIN eKYC Filing - Filing Form DIR-3 KYC</h2>
      <p>
        The Director Identification Number (DIN) is an essential identifier for
        anyone aspiring to be a director in Indian companies, and it is issued
        by the Ministry of Corporate Affairs (MCA). It's crucial for maintaining
        a record of an individual's involvement in corporate governance.
        Directors are required to update their KYC details annually through the
        DIR-3 KYC form with the MCA. Failure to do so leads to the deactivation
        of the DIN, which restricts their ability to function in corporate
        roles. To reactivate a deactivated DIN, directors need to file the DIR-3
        KYC form, sometimes with a late fee, depending on the delay.
      </p>

      <h3>Director Identification Number (DIN)</h3>
      <p>
        A Director Identification Number (DIN) is a compulsory requirement for
        both current and prospective directors of a company. This 8-digit Unique
        Identification Number is assigned to directors in accordance with the
        guidelines established by the Companies Act.
      </p>

      <h3>DIN eKYC Filing</h3>
      <p>
        DIN is obtained by submitting an application in eForm DIR-3, which was
        originally intended to be a one-time process for anyone wishing to
        become a director of one or more companies.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, as a result of an amendment to MCA’s register, all directors
        with DIN are now required to submit their KYC details in e-Form DIR 3
        KYC every year.
      </p>

      <h3>What is Form DIR-3 KYC?</h3>
      <p>
        As mentioned, Form DIR-3 KYC is an electronic form mandated by the
        Ministry of Corporate Affairs (MCA) for the purpose of updating the KYC
        (Know Your Customer) details of individuals who have been allotted a
        Director Identification Number (DIN).
      </p>

      <h4>Applicability</h4>
      <p>
        Form DIR-3 KYC is a mandatory filing requirement under the Companies
        (Appointment and Qualification of Directors) Rules, 2014. It applies to
        individuals who have been allotted a Director Identification Number
        (DIN) and whose DIN status is 'approved'.
      </p>

      <h4>Purpose of DIR-3 KYC (Know Your Customer)</h4>
      <p>
        The purpose of this form is to conduct the annual KYC (Know Your
        Customer) process for directors, which must be submitted to the
        Registrar of Companies (ROC). This form is essential for maintaining
        current and accurate director information with the ROC, including
        addresses, contact numbers, and email addresses.
      </p>

      <h3>Who is required to submit Form DIR 3 KYC?</h3>
      <p>
        Directors are required to submit their KYC details to the MCA if they
        meet the following conditions, according to recent MCA announcements:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Their Director Identification Number (DIN) was assigned to them by or

        </li>
        <li>DIN is in approved status</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Types of DIR-3 KYC Forms</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>DIR-3 KYC eForm:</strong> First-time filers of DIR-3 KYC must
          use the eForm DIR-3 KYC, accessible on the MCA (Ministry of Corporate
          Affairs) portal. This form is also required for existing filers who
          need to update their mobile number, email address or any other
          details.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>DIR-3 KYC web form:</strong> The DIR-3 KYC web form is a
          simplified version available for DIN holders who have previously filed
          a DIR-3 KYC eForm. Accessible through the MCA web service, this form
          streamlines the filing process by pre-filling most of the information,
          making annual DIR-3 compliance more efficient.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Documents Required</h3>
      <p>The following documents are required to file Form DIR-3 KYC :</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Digital Signature Certificate (DSC):</strong> DSC linked to
          the individual's PAN.
        </li>
        <li>

          card.
        </li>

        the filing requirement within the stipulated timeframe.
      </p>

      <h3>DIN Deactivation</h3>
      <p>
        If a director fails to submit e-Form DIR-3 KYC by the 30th of September
        on the MCA portal, their Director Identification Number (DIN) will be
        marked as 'Deactivated due to Non-filing of DIR-3 KYC' by the
        department.
      </p>
      <p>
        Every holder of a Director Identification Number (DIN) whose DIN has
        been deactivated due to non-compliance with the DIR-3 KYC filing
        requirement must file the e-form DIR-3 KYC or complete the KYC process
        through the designated web service, along with paying the applicable
        fee.
      </p>
      <p>
        After the DIR-3 KYC form is submitted, it undergoes a Straight Through
        Processing (STP) for approval. Upon successful approval, the system
        automatically reactivates the deactivated DIN. This process ensures that
        all directors maintain up-to-date KYC information as per regulatory
        requirements.
