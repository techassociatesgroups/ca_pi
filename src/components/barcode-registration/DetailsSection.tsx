            specific applications and industries:

            <li>
              <strong>GS1 EAN/UPC Family Barcodes:</strong> These are the first
              and most commonly utilized GS1 barcodes. Known as GTINs (Global
              Trade Item Numbers) or EANs, these barcodes facilitate the
              marketing of products through modern retail channels.

            Barcode Registration
          </h3>
          <p>
            Barcode registration refers to assigning a unique identification
            code to a product or item and linking it to a barcode symbol. This
            identification code can track the item through the supply chain and
            facilitate inventory management, pricing, and other business
            processes.
          </p>
          <p className="mt-2">
            To register a barcode, you must obtain a unique identification
            number from a global organization such as GS1 or EAN International.
            These organizations maintain databases of registered identification
            numbers and issue them to companies that want to use GS1 barcodes
            for their products.
          </p>
          <p className="mt-2">
            Once you have obtained an identification number, you can generate
            barcode symbols using software or hardware that supports the barcode
            format you want to use (e.g., UPC, EAN, Code 39, etc.). You can then
            print the barcode on labels or packaging for your products, ensuring
            the barcode symbol and identification code are correctly linked in
            your database.
          </p>
          <p className="mt-2">
            Registering your barcodes with a global organization ensures that
            your product information is globally recognized and standardized,
            allowing for efficient tracking and communication across different
            supply chain systems.
