        <h3>What is Halal Certificate?</h3>
        <p>
          Halal Certification is predominantly obtained for food and
          food-related products, and it is essential in Islamic countries. The
          term "Halal" is derived from the Quran, which means "permitted" or
          "lawful." Therefore, according to Islamic law, the Shariah, the
          Certification is used for Food and other consumables permissible for
          consumption. Halal India Certification emphasizes cleanliness in all
          aspects of a person's life, and Halal foods ensure that the Food
          consumed by individuals is clean, hygienic, and does not harm their
          health or well-being. The Certification guarantees that the food
          product is safe for consumption. With the increasing awareness of
          Halal foods, more businesses are seeking Halal Certification for their
          products, restaurants, premises, etc.
        </p>

        <h3>What is Halal Certification in India?</h3>
        <p>
          In India, a Halal Certificate is a document issued by a Halal
          certification body or authority confirming that a product or service
          complies with Islamic dietary laws and guidelines and is permissible
          or "Halal" for consumption by Muslims.
        </p>
        <p>
          Halal Certification in India is significant for food and beverage
          products, pharmaceuticals, and personal care products. Still, it can
          also apply to other non-food products or services. Businesses seeking
          Halal Certification in India must comply with the relevant standards
          and guidelines set forth by the certification body or authority and
          undergo a rigorous inspection and audit process to ensure compliance.
        </p>

        <h3>Types of Halal Certification</h3>
        <p>
          The type of Halal Certification varies depending on the nature of the
          business. Typically, restaurants, hotels, slaughterhouses, and
          packaging and labeling materials seek Halal Certification to ensure
          they meet the requirements of Muslim consumers. However, Halal
          Certification is not limited to food production alone. Other products,
          such as non-alcoholic beverages, raw materials for food processing,
          pharmaceutical and healthcare products, traditional herbal products,
          cosmetics, personal care products, cleaning products, and everyday
          consumer goods, can also obtain Halal Certification.
        </p>
        <p>
          Halal Certification Bodies offer Certification under various schemes,
          including the Food, and Catering Scheme, Restaurant Scheme, Industrial
          Scheme, Abattoir Scheme, Warehouse or Storage Scheme, and Product
          Endorsement Scheme.

        </p>

        <h3>Halal Certification Procedure</h3>
        <p>
          The procedure to obtain Halal Certification in India is as follows:
        </p>
        <ol className="list-decimal pl-5">
          <li>
            <strong>Step 1: Application</strong>
            <br />
            The business wishing to obtain Halal Certification must apply to one
            of the Certification Bodies. At CA PI, we help businesses understand
            the requirements for obtaining Halal Certification and provide
            guidance on the application process.
          </li>
          <li className="mt-2">
            <strong>Step 2: Conducting the Audit</strong>
            <br />
            After the business has submitted its application, a team of auditors
            (typically one Shariah Auditor and one Technical Auditor) will
            conduct an on-site inspection of the business's operations. The
            auditors will review and assess the following areas to ensure that
            they meet the requirements for Halal Certification:
            <ul className="list-disc pl-5 mt-2">
              <li>Documentation</li>
              <li>Processing, handling, and distribution of products</li>
              <li>Storage, display, and serving of products</li>
              <li>Cleanliness, sanitation, and food safety</li>
              <li>Overall condition of the premises</li>
              <li>Tools, equipment, and machinery</li>
              <li>Packaging and labeling</li>
            </ul>
            During the audit, the business may need to provide criteria for
            accepting raw materials, a certificate of analysis, and a Halal
            certificate for individual components. Once the audit is completed,
            the audit report is to be signed.
          </li>
          <li className="mt-2">
            <strong>Step 3: Certification</strong>
            <br />
            After the audit, the Halal Certification Body's Technical Committee
            will review the audit report and other relevant documents the
            business provides. If the auditors' report is satisfactory, and the
            company and its products meet the Halal certification criteria, the
            Halal Certification Body will issue the Halal Certificate. The
            certificate will include detail such as the name and address of the
            business, the scope of the Certification, and the validity period.
          </li>
        </ol>
