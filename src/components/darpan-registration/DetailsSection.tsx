            What is Darpan Registration?
          </h3>
          <p className="mb-4">
            Darpan Registration refers to the process of registering a
            Non-Government Organisation (NGO) or Voluntary Organisation (VO) on
            the NGO Darpan portal of Niti Aayog, an online platform developed by
            NITI Aayog in collaboration with the National Informatics Center
            (NIC, MeITY). Launched by the Indian Government in 2015, the portal
            serves as a centralized and national database of Darpan registration
            for trusts, NGOs and VOs in India.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-4">
            During the NGO Darpan Portal registration, NGOs and VOs provide
            self-declared information about their activities, projects, sources
            of income, and other relevant details. This registration process
            helps the government and other stakeholders gain a better
            understanding of the activities and impact of NGOs across different
            sectors and locations.
          </p>
          <p className="font-semibold mb-2">
            The primary objectives of Darpan Registration for Trusts, NGOs and
            VOs include:
          </p>
          <ul className="space-y-2 pl-5 list-disc">
            <li>
              Facilitating Government Grants and Funding: NGOs receive a Unique
              Darpan ID upon registration, which simplifies the process of
              applying for government grants and funding.
            </li>
            <li>
              Enhancing Transparency and Accountability: By making the
              information publicly accessible, the Darpan portal of Niti Aayog
              ensures greater transparency and accountability in NGO activities.
            </li>
            <li>
              Creating a Comprehensive Database: The centralized database helps
              in the efficient management and monitoring of NGOs and their
              contributions to various social causes.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p className="mt-4">
            Overall, NGO Darpan Portal registration is a crucial step for NGOs
            and VOs seeking to enhance their credibility, secure government
            support, and ensure their operations are transparent and
            accountable.
