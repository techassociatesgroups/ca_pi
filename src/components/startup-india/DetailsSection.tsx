          Benefits of Startup India Registration
        </h3>
        <p className="text-gray-600 mb-4">
          Startup India Registration offers an extensive range of benefits to
          support startups, like funding support and tax exemptions. We have
          outlined some of the benefits below:
        </p>
        <ul className="space-y-4 text-gray-600">
          <li>
            <strong className="text-gray-800">
              Patents, Trademarks, and Design Registration:
            </strong>{" "}
            Startups that need to secure patents for innovations or trademarks
            for their business can access facilitators from a
            government-approved list. By engaging these facilitators, startups
            benefit from an 80% reduction in fees, covering only the statutory
            charges.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong className="text-gray-800">Funding Support:</strong> To
            mitigate this, the government has set up a fund with an initial
            corpus of Rs. 2,500 crore, aiming for a total of Rs. 10,000 crore
            over four years. This fund, functioning as a Fund of Funds, invests
            in the capital of SEBI-registered venture funds, thus providing
            indirect financial support to startups.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong className="text-gray-800">
              Self-certification under Employment and Labour Laws:
            </strong>{" "}
            Startups can self-certify compliance under specific labour and
            environmental laws, reducing the compliance burden and associated
            costs. This allows startups to self-certify under six labour laws
            and three environmental laws for three to five years
            post-incorporation.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong className="text-gray-800">
              Environment-Related Acts Exemption:
            </strong>{" "}
            Startups in the thirty-six industries categorised as 'white' by the
            Central Pollution Control Board are exempt from certain
            environmental clearances under three specific acts for up to three
            years.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong className="text-gray-800">Tax Exemption:</strong>{" "}
            DPIIT-recognized startups are entitled to an income tax exemption
            for three consecutive financial years out of their first ten years
            since incorporation. Moreover, startups can apply for an exemption
            from angel tax under Section 56 of the Income Tax Act.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong className="text-gray-800">Streamlined Winding up:</strong>{" "}
            Startups can shut down their operations within 90 days from the date
            of making the application, providing a hassle-free exit strategy for
            businesses that need to cease operations.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong className="text-gray-800">
              Relaxed Public Procurement Norms:
            </strong>{" "}
            Startups recognised by DPIIT are allowed to compete in public
            procurements without the typical prerequisites of prior turnover and
            experience requirements.
          </li>
