          Trust & Trust Registration - An Overview
        </h3>
        <p className="text-gray-600">
          Individuals establish trusts to allocate a portion of their assets or
          property for the benefit of another person. A trust is a fiduciary

          registration for trust creation.
        </p>

          property to the trustee for the ultimate benefit of the beneficiary.
          The beneficiary, who is typically a third party, may have a connection
          to both the trustor and the trustee.
