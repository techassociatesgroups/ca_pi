          In India, non-profit organisations can benefit significantly from two
          specific registrations provided by the Income Tax Department: 12A and
          80G. The 12A registration grants non-profit organizations an exemption
          from paying income tax on their earned income, which can greatly aid
          in maximising the funds available for their charitable activities.
          Additionally, the 80G registration offers a substantial benefit to the
          donors of these organisations, allowing them to claim deductions on
          their taxable income for any donations made. So, the 12A and 80G
          registration process online must be done by the non-profit
          organisations to avail tax deduction benefits.

        <p>
          At CA PI, we understand the importance of obtaining Section 12A and
          80G registrations for your non-profit organisation. We offer
          comprehensive assistance and guidance throughout the registration
          process to help you get the benefits and privileges provided under
          these sections of the Income Tax Act.

            What is 12A and 80g Registration?
          </h3>
          <p>
            12A and 80G registrations are critical tax provisions for NGOs in
            India, enabling charitable institutions to avail themselves of
            specific tax exemptions and benefits. These exemptions are governed
            by Sections 12A/12AA and 80G of the Income Tax Act of 1961:
          </p>
          <div className="mt-4 space-y-2">
            <h4 className="font-semibold">12A Registration</h4>
            <p>
              This certification is provided under the Income Tax Act 1961 to
              non-profit organisations in India. Once registered under Section
              12A, an NGO becomes eligible for tax exemption on its income,
              meaning it doesn’t have to pay tax on surplus funds generated
              through grants, donations, or other revenue as long as these funds
              are used for charitable purposes. This registration is crucial for
              NGOs as it helps in maximising the funds available for their
              activities.
            </p>
            <h4 className="font-semibold mt-2">80G Registration</h4>
            <p>
              While 12A registration benefits the NGO, 80G registration is
              intended to incentivise donors. It allows individuals or entities
              who donate to a 12A-registered NGO to claim a deduction on their
              income tax. This deduction is a percentage of the amount donated
              and can significantly reduce the donor's taxable income. The
              purpose of this provision is to encourage more donations by
              providing financial benefits to donors.
            </p>
            <p className="mt-2">
              The key difference between 12A and 80G is that 12A registration
              provides tax exemption on an NGO’s income, while 80G registration
              allows donors to avail tax deductions on their donations. Both
              registrations enhance NGOs' ability to attract contributions by
              offering fiscal advantages to both the organisations and their
              benefactors. So, it is useful to register and obtain the 12A 80G
              certificate.

            Benefits of 12A and 80G Registrations
          </h3>
          <p>
            The benefits of obtaining 80G and 12A registrations for charitable
            organizations and NGOs are substantial, impacting various aspects of
            their operations:
          </p>
          <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mt-2 space-y-1">
            <li>
              <strong>Tax Exemptions for Donors:</strong> NGOs with 80G
              certification can offer their donors the advantage of tax
              deductions on their contributions. This makes donating more
              attractive and can lead to increased support.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Enhanced Credibility and Trust:</strong> Being registered
              under Section 12A and 80G lends an official stamp of approval from
              the Income Tax Department, enhancing an NGO's credibility. This
              trust factor is crucial for donors and partners who seek
              transparency in operations.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Increased Fundraising Potential:</strong> The tax benefits
              associated with these registrations encourage both individuals and
              corporate entities to donate more generously. This broadens the
              potential fundraising base, allowing NGOs to expand their
              activities and reach.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Access to Government Grants:</strong> Many government
              programs and initiatives require NGOs to have 12A and 80G
              registrations to qualify for funding. This opens up numerous
              opportunities for grants that are critical for project financing
              and operations.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Long-Term Sustainability:</strong> The ability to offer
              tax benefits to donors not only boosts immediate donations but
              also helps in building long-term partnerships, ensuring
              sustainable funding sources. This stability allows NGOs to plan
              and execute impactful, long-term projects.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Efficient Utilization of Resources:</strong> With 12A
              registration, NGOs must maintain meticulous records and use their
              funds strictly for charitable purposes. This ensures that
              resources are used effectively and for the intended goals of the
              organisation.

          </ul>

            Overall, 12A and 80G registrations not only help in managing and
            expanding financial resources through tax benefits but also play a
            vital role in building organizational reputation and operational
            capacity.

          <p>
            The validity of 12A and 80G registrations depends on the type of
