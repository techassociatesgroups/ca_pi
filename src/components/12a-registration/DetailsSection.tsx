          12A Registration, granted by the Income Tax Department, is a one-time
          registration for trusts and other nonprofit organizations. The primary
          objective of this Registration is to obtain an exemption from income
          tax payment. Generally, organizations apply for 12A Registration soon
          after their incorporation. Nonprofit entities such as Section 8
          Companies, Trusts, and NGOs that have obtained 12A Registration are
          entitled to income tax exemption on their surplus income.

            Section 12A of Income Tax Act
          </h3>
          <p>
            After establishing a Trust organization or NGO, it is necessary to
            register under Section 12A of the Income Tax Act to claim exemptions
            provided by Sections 11 and 12. Section 12A allows nonprofit
            entities such as Charitable Trusts, Nonprofit Organizations, Welfare
            Societies, Religious Institutions, etc., to enjoy total tax
            exemption per the Income Tax Act of 1961 provisions.
          </p>
          <p>
            If a non-profit trust or NGO fails to register for form 12a income
            tax, their financial receipts and transactions will be taxable. It's
            important to note that private or family trusts are not eligible for
            such exemptions and cannot obtain 12A Registration for trusts,
            institutions, etc.

            What is 12A registration?
          </h3>
          <p>
            NGOs, trusts, and charitable trusts must understand what is 12A
            registration. 12A registration is a crucial process under the Income
            Tax Act in India, designed for NPOs, including trusts, NGOs, and
            Section 8 companies. It is granted by the Income Tax Department and
            allows these entities to be exempt from paying income tax on their
            surplus income utilized for charitable or religious purposes.
            Organizations typically apply for 12A registration immediately after
            incorporation to avail of tax benefits and enhance their
            credibility. The registration process involves applying Form 10A
            online and the necessary documentation to verify the organization's
            charitable activities. Once approved, the registration remains valid
            unless cancelled.

            Benefits of 12A Registration
          </h3>
          <p>
            The advantages associated with Filing Form 12A and obtaining 12A
            registration online are as follows:
          </p>
          <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mt-2 space-y-1">
            <li>
              <strong>Income Application:</strong> The funds utilized for
              charitable or religious purposes are considered the application of
              income. This means that expenses incurred for such purposes are
              considered when calculating the nonprofit organization's taxable
              income.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Income Tax Exemption:</strong> Income received by the
              organization with a 12A certificate will be exempt from the charge
              of Income Tax. This exemption allows the organization to allocate
              more resources toward its philanthropic endeavours.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Accumulation of Income:</strong> Registered entities can
              accumulate or set aside income for future use. However, the amount
              set aside should not exceed 15% of the funds for charitable or
              non-commercial purposes.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Exclusion from Total Income:</strong> The income that is
              accumulated and considered as the income application is not
              included in the assessee's total income. This helps in reducing
              the tax liability of the organization.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Access to Grants:</strong> NGOs with Section 12A
              registration are eligible to receive grants from both domestic and
              international sources. Various agencies and institutions
              specifically provide grants to NGOs that have obtained
              Registration under this section.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>One-Time Registration:</strong> The Registration granted
              under Section 12A is treated as a one-time registration. Once
              registered, the organization remains active until the date of
              cancellation, eliminating the need for periodic renewal.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Flexible Benefits:</strong> Form 12A income tax Registered
              NGOs can avail themselves of the registration benefits as and when
              required, without any rigid renewal process. This flexibility
              allows organizations to use the benefits based on their needs and
              circumstances.
