          What is Public Limited Company in India?
        </h2>
        <p>
          A public limited company meaning defined by its unique function, which
          is a form of corporate entity that permits the general public to hold
          ownership stakes through publicly traded shares. These shares are
          commonly exchanged on established stock markets, enabling a diverse
          group of brokers, investors, and traders to buy and sell equity. This
          structure allows individuals from various backgrounds to invest and
          hold shares in the company.
        </p>
        <p className="mt-4">
          Unlike private companies, public limited companies are governed by
          stricter regulatory and reporting standards. In India, the law
          governing public limited companies is primarily outlined in the
          Companies Act of 2013. The public company minimum members is 7, and
          there is no limit on the maximum number of members /shareholders for
          starting a Public Limited Company.
        </p>
        <p className="mt-4">
          The day-to-day operations are managed by an executive team, but the
          broader ownership lies with the many shareholders who invest in the
          company's stock. These shareholders typically have voting rights that
          include the ability to vote on the election of the board of directors.
          The board then selects the executive team tasked with managing the
          company's ongoing business affairs. It is important to remember to
          meet the minimum shareholders in public company to proceed in the
          functions.

            three directors, with no upper limit on the number. The board of

            and strategic decision-making.

          Types of Public Limited Company
        </h2>
        <p>
          Public limited companies are broadly categorised into two distinct
          types:
        </p>
        <h3 className="font-semibold text-gray-700 mt-4">Listed Company</h3>
        <p>
          This type of public limited company has its shares actively listed and
          available for trading on one or more stock exchanges. This
          accessibility allows the public and various financial entities to buy
          and sell the company's shares, providing greater liquidity and
          exposure to a diverse pool of investors.
        </p>
        <h3 className="font-semibold text-gray-700 mt-4">Unlisted Company</h3>
        <p>
          Unlike its listed counterparts, an unlisted public limited company
          does not have its shares traded on any stock exchange. As a result,
          its shares are not as easily transferable, and the company does not
          experience the same level of public scrutiny or regulatory
          requirements as a listed company. This category of public limited
          company may appeal to businesses seeking to benefit from a broader
          base of shareholders while avoiding the complexities of full public
          trading.
