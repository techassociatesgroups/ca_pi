          <p>
            LEI Code full form stands for "Legal Entitiy Identifier". As
            mentioned, A LEI Code meaning refers to a distinct 20-digit

          <p className="mt-2">
            An LEI code can be obtained from any of the Local Operating Units
            (LOUs) accredited by the Global Legal Entity Identifier Foundation
            (GLEIF), which oversees the implementation and use of LEIs
            worldwide. In India, the Legal Entity Identifier India Ltd. (LEIL)
            serves as an official issuer recognised by the Reserve Bank of India

          <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">Importance of LEI Code</h3>
          <p>
            The importance of a Legal Entity Identifier (LEI) code lies in its
            ability to enhance transparency and security within the global
            financial system. Here are the key reasons why LEI register codes
            are crucial:
          </p>
          <ul className="list-disc list-inside mt-2 space-y-1">
            <li>
              <strong>Improved Transparency:</strong> LEI registration code
              clearly identify legal entities engaged in financial transactions
              worldwide, reducing the ambiguity that can arise from similar
              names or different business units within the same company.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Risk Management:</strong> By providing precise and
              accessible data about entities, LEIs help financial institutions
              and regulators manage counterparty and credit risks more
              effectively.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Regulatory Compliance:</strong> Many regulatory frameworks
              require LEIs and LEI Certificate registration for reporting and
              compliance purposes. Entities without an LEI may face restrictions
              or be unable to participate in certain financial transactions.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Operational Efficiency:</strong> LEI registration code
              simplifies various operational processes by providing each entity
              with a standardised, universal identifier. This can streamline
              transactions, reporting, and record-keeping.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Fraud Prevention:</strong> With LEIs, the financial sector
              can more easily trace transactions back to the entities involved,
              helping to detect and prevent fraudulent activities.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Market Integrity:</strong> LEIs contribute to the
              integrity of financial markets by ensuring that all participants
              are clearly and consistently identified, making it easier to
              assess and control systemic risk.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p className="mt-2">
            Overall, LEIs are foundational in making global financial markets
            more stable, transparent, and efficient.

          <p>
            LEI codes are valid for one year from the date of issuance and
            require annual renewal to ensure the information they contain
            remains current and accurate. For example, an LEI issued on February
            1, 2023, must be renewed by February 1, 2024.

            Failure to renew by the deadline results in the LEI becoming

            all the LEI registration requirements before initiating the process.
            Here is a brief guide on how to get your LEI code:

          <ol className="list-decimal list-inside mt-2 space-y-2">
            <li>
              <strong>Step 1: Prepare Required Documents</strong>
              <br />
              Begin by downloading the necessary document list and formats for
              your legal entity type from the LEIL website, specifically from
              the "Downloads -&gt; Legal Docs Download" tab. This will ensure

            <li>
              <strong>Step 2: Self-Registration on the Online Portal</strong>
              <br />
              Visit LEIL's website and create an account using your official
              email address. Only authorised officials, defined as those
              empowered through a Letter of Authority or General Board
