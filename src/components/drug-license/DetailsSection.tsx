        <Section title="What is a Drug Licence?">
          <p>
            In India, businesses must have the right licenses for their
            operations, including those dealing drugs and cosmetics. A drug
            licence issued by the government requires firms to legally
            manufacture, distribute, or sell pharmaceutical and cosmetic
            products. These licenses are specific to each region, meaning a
            separate permit is needed for operations in different states.
            Moreover, a distinct pharma license is required for each location if
            a business operates in multiple locations within a single state.
            Selling pharmaceutical products which do not have proper drug
            licenses leads to the cancellation of a pharmacy license. Drug
            licence verification can be done by the officials to ensure the
            safety. However, there's an exception for mobile vendors.

          <p>
            A drug licence is an authorisation issued by regulatory bodies that
            allows a business to engage in drug-related activities. Obtaining a
            drug licence is a prerequisite for initiating any drug-related
            business operations. The definition of a "drug" is provided in
            section 3(b) of The Drugs And Cosmetics Act, 1940, and encompasses.

            Therefore, the term "drug" encompasses all forms of medicines,
            including Allopathic, Homeopathic, Ayurvedic, Siddha, and Unani. For
            licensing purposes for pharma licence, these medicines can be
            categorised into two main groups.
