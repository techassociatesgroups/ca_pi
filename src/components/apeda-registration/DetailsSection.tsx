            What is APEDA?
          </h3>
          <p>
            APEDA, established under the APEDA Act of 1985, is a government
            authority tasked with regulating and promoting the export of
            agricultural and processed food products from India. APEDA
            Registration, also known as APEDA RCMC Registration, is a mandatory
            requirement for exporters dealing with scheduled products. This
            certification ensures that exporters comply with export regulations
            and provides access to various benefits, including financial

          <p>
            APEDA Registration, also referred to as APEDA RCMC Registration
            (Registration-Cum-Membership Certificate (RCMC)), is issued by the
            APEDA authorities to exporters of scheduled food products under the
            APEDA Act of 1985. This registration is a compulsory requirement for
            any exporter intending to engage in the export of listed
            agricultural and processed food products. Without an RCMC
            membership, exporters cannot legally commence their business
            activities related to these products as per regulatory guidelines.
            The APEDA RCMC registration form must be accurately filled out and
            submitted as part of the APEDA online registration procedure. Ensure
            to get an RCMC APEDA certificate.
