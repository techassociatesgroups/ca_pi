            standards mandated by the State Municipal Corporation, safeguarding
            residents from potential health hazards. Obtaining a trade license
            is mandatory for all businesses falling under the purview of the

            commercial activities nationwide by mandating online trading
            licenses. This regulatory framework promotes societal harmony by
            ensuring every business adheres to relevant rules, guidelines, and
