        A Producer Company is an officially established group of farmers or
        agriculturists to enhance their quality of life, financial support, and
        income. This kind of company combines elements of both private limited
        companies and cooperatives. Its primary goal is to encourage cooperative
        businesses to form as companies and to allow current cooperatives to
        transition into company structures.
